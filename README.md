# Knot System

A small system with a personal website and a Feed Reader, based on the Micropub, Microsub and IndieAuth protocols.

Use the [Knot Installer](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-installer) to install a full system with all modules, or install individual modules directly: [Knot Site](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-site), [Knot Home](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-home), [Knot Daemon](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-daemon), [Knot Auth](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-auth) and [Knot Control](https://github.com/knot-system/knot-control)

**This is an early beta version!** Some things may break, or change in the future!
